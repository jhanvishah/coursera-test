  <h1>HTML 5</h1>
  <section>
    Introduction:
    <article>HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and current version of the HTML standard.</article>
    <article> HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends, improves and rationalizes the markup available for documents, and introduces markup and application programming interfaces (APIs) for complex web applications.[6] For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a candidate for cross-platform mobile applications, because it includes features designed with low-powered devices in mind.</article>

    Features:
    <article>HTML5 introduces elements and attributes that reflect typical usage on modern websites. Some of them are semantic replacements for common uses of generic block (&lt;div&gt;) and inline (&lt;span&gt;) elements, for example &lt;nav&gt; (website navigation block), &lt;footer&gt; (usually referring to bottom of web page or to last lines of HTML code), or &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; instead of &lt;object&gt;.</article>
